# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Sample application

This app was created as i followed the Michael Hartl tutorial from his book, [The Ruby on Rails Tutorial]. The aims of this task was for me to gain a better understanding of Rails. I followed the tutorial but ran into some problems with versions Gemfiles causing errors. I had to put this app on hold for the time being due to these errors as i try to work through them and resolve them, it has been a great learning experience for me.
